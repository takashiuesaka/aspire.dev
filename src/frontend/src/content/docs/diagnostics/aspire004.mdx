> The Project reference isn't to an executable project, so won't be launched. Did you mean to set IsAspireProjectResource="false"?

The project being referenced by the Aspire AppHost isn't an executable, but is being treated like one for the purposes of orchestration.

## To correct this warning

Either change the build type of the project to an executable, or add the `IsAspireProjectResource="false"` setting to the project reference in your Aspire AppHost project file, as demonstrated in the following snippet:

```xml title="C# project file"
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="..\OtherProjects\Contracts.csproj" IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Suppress the warning

Suppress the warning with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIRE004.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIRE004</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```
