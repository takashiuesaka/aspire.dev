> `AddPythonApp` is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.

Aspire provides a way to add Python executables or applications to the Aspire AppHost with the `AddPythonApp` extension. Since the shape of this API is expected to change in the future, it's experimental.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREHOSTINGPYTHON001`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var pythonApp = builder.AddPythonApp("hello-python", "../hello-python", "main.py")
       .WithHttpEndpoint(env: "PORT")
       .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
       .WithOtlpExporter();
```

## To correct this error

Suppress the error with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIREHOSTINGPYTHON001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREHOSTINGPYTHON001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIREHOSTINGPYTHON001` directive.
