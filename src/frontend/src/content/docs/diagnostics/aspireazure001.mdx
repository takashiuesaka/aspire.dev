The Aspire Azure hosting integration now ships with a publisher. If you're using any of the `Aspire.Hosting.AzurePublisherExtensions.AddAzurePublisher*` APIs, you might see a compiler error/warning indicating that the API is experimental. This behavior is expected, as the API is still in preview and the shape of this API is expected to change in the future.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREAZURE001`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
builder.AddAzurePublisher();
```

## To correct this error

Suppress the error with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIREAZURE001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREAZURE001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIREAZURE001` directive.
