> Deployment state manager APIs are for evaluation purposes only and are subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.

Aspire introduced deployment state manager APIs as part of the pipeline infrastructure starting in version 13.0. These APIs enable you to manage and persist deployment state information across pipeline executions. The deployment state manager provides functionality for storing, retrieving, and clearing deployment artifacts and metadata, which is essential for incremental deployments and tracking deployment history.

Deployment state manager APIs are considered experimental and are expected to change in future updates.

## APIs affected

This diagnostic applies to the following deployment state manager APIs:

- `IDeploymentStateManager` - Interface for managing deployment state
- Deployment state manager implementations
- `Deploy` property in `PublishingOptions`
- `ClearCache` property in `PublishingOptions`
- `Step` property in `PublishingOptions`
- `DeployingCallbackAnnotation` - Annotation for deploying callbacks
- Azure provisioning context providers
- Related extension methods and implementations
