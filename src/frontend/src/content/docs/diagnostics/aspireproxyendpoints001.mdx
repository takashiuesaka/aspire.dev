Both `WithEndpointProxySupport` and `ProxySupportAnnotation` are considered experimental APIs.

Container resources use proxied endpoints by default. Adjusting this setting is experimental.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREPROXYENDPOINTS001`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.AddRedis($"example-redis", 1234)
                   .WithEndpointProxySupport(false);
```

## To correct this error

Suppress the error with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIREPROXYENDPOINTS001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREPROXYENDPOINTS001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIREPROXYENDPOINTS001` directive.
