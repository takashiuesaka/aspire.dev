## Name

`aspire cache clear` - Clear all cache entries.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire cache clear [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire cache clear` command removes all cached data stored by the Aspire CLI. This includes downloaded templates, NuGet package metadata, and other temporary files used to improve CLI performance.

Clearing the cache forces the CLI to re-download templates and refresh package information on the next operation, which can help resolve issues related to stale or corrupted cache data.

## Options

The following options are available:

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-debug.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-wait.md" />

## Examples

- Clear all cached data:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire cache clear
  ```

## What gets cleared

The `aspire cache clear` command removes:

- Downloaded project templates
- NuGet package metadata and search results
- Integration package information
- Temporary build artifacts
- Other CLI operation caches

<Aside type="note">
  This command does not remove: - The Aspire CLI installation itself -
  Configuration settings (those are managed by `aspire config`) - Your Aspire
  projects or their dependencies
</Aside>

## Performance impact

After clearing the cache:

- The first `aspire new` command may take longer as templates are re-downloaded
- The first `aspire add` command may be slower as package information is refreshed
- Subsequent operations will benefit from the rebuilt cache
