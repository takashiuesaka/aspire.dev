## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire run [options] [[--] <additional arguments>...]

<Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/project-search-logic-description.md" />

The command performs the following steps to run an Aspire AppHost:

- Creates or modifies the `.aspire/settings.json` config file in the current directory, and sets the `appHostPath` config value to the path of the AppHost project file.
- Installs or verifies that Aspire's local hosting certificates are installed and trusted.
- Builds the AppHost project and its resources.
- Starts the AppHost and its resources.
- Starts the dashboard.

The following snippet is an example of the output displayed by the `aspire run` command:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Dashboard:  https://localhost:17244/login?t=9db79f2885dae24ee06c6ef10290b8b2

    Logs:  /home/vscode/.aspire/cli/logs/apphost-5932-2025-08-25-18-37-31.log

        Press CTRL+C to stop the apphost and exit.
```
