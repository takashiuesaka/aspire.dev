In this tutorial, you take the app you created in the [Build your first Aspire app](/get-started/first-app/) quickstart and deploy it. This can be broken down into several key steps:

<Steps>

1. [Add deployment package](#add-deployment-package) — Add the hosting package for your target.
1. [Update your AppHost](#update-your-apphost) — Configure the environment API.
1. [Deploy your app](#deploy-your-app) — Deploy using the Aspire CLI.
1. [Verify your deployment](#verify-your-deployment) — Ensure your app is running as expected.
1. [Clean up resources](#clean-up-resources) — Remove any deployed resources to avoid incurring costs.

</Steps>

The following diagram shows the architecture of the sample app you're deploying:

<Pivot id="csharp">
```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api-docker(logos:docker-icon)[API container]
    group f-docker(logos:docker-icon)[Front end container]

    service api(logos:dotnet)[API service] in api-docker
    service http(iconoir:server-connection)[https]
    service frontend(aspire:blazor)[Blazor front end] in f-docker

    frontend:L --> R:http
    http:L --> R:api
```

The ASP.NET Core Blazor & Minimal API starter template consists of two resources, each deployed as a separate container.
</Pivot>
<Pivot id="python">

```mermaid

  group docker(logos:docker-icon)[Python and static site server container]  

  service api(logos:fastapi)[API service] in docker
  service http(iconoir:server-connection)[https] in docker
  service frontend(logos:react)[React front end] in docker

  frontend:L --> R:http
  http:L --> R:api
```

The React (Vite) & FastAPI starter template consists of two resources that are deployed as a single container. The FastAPI server hosts both the API and the static frontend files generated by React.

## Add deployment package

In the root directory of your Aspire solution that you created in the previous quickstart, add the appropriate hosting deployment package by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="deploy-target">
    <TabItem id="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

        [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, making it easier to manage and deploy complex applications locally or in various environments.

        ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Add Docker Compose"
        aspire add docker
        ```

        The Aspire CLI is interactive, be sure to select the appropriate search result for the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Docker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Docker) version you want to add.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem id="azure" label="Azure">

        ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Add Azure App Containers"
        aspire add azure-appcontainers
        ```

        The Aspire CLI is interactive, be sure to select the appropriate search result for the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppContainers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppContainers) version you want to add.

    </TabItem>

    If prompted for additional selections, use the <Kbd windows="↑" mac="↑" /> and <Kbd windows="↓" mac="↓" /> keys to navigate the options. Press <Kbd windows="Enter" mac="Return" /> to confirm your selection.

<Aside type="tip" title="CLI protip" icon="forward-slash">
After installing a new deployment package, you can run `aspire do diagnostics` in your terminal to see the available deploy steps. For more information, see the [aspire do diagnostics](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-do/) reference docs.
</Aside>

## Deploy your app

Now that you've added the deployment package and updated your AppHost, you can deploy your Aspire app.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Deploy your app"
aspire deploy
```

When you call `aspire deploy`, the Aspire CLI builds the container images for your resources, pushes them to the target environment (if applicable), and deploys the resources according to the configuration in your AppHost.

<Aside type="note" title="Common pitfall..." icon="seti:todo">
If you call `aspire deploy` and you see output similar to the following, be sure that you've actually [updated your AppHost](#update-your-apphost) to include the appropriate environment API for your target. This output indicates that there are no deploy steps configured for your target environment.

```bash title="Aspire CLI - Empty deployment output"

### Post deployment output

After a deployment, the Aspire CLI writes to the provided output path (or the default output path if none is provided) a set of files based on your deployment target. This may include files such as Docker Compose files, Kubernetes manifests, or cloud provider-specific configuration files.

<Tabs syncKey="deploy-target">
    <TabItem id="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

    <Pivot id="csharp">
        <FileTree>
        - aspire-output
          - .env
          - .env.Production
          - docker-compose.yaml
        </FileTree>

        The `aspire-output` directory contains the generated environment variables and the Docker Compose configuration. The best part is, these files are opaque to you as a developer—you don't need to write them yourself!

        The `.env.Production` file contains the name of the app image:

        ```dotenv title="./aspire-output/.env.Production"
        # Container image name for apiservice
        APISERVICE_IMAGE=apiservice:latest

        # Default container port for apiservice
        APISERVICE_PORT=8080

        # Container image name for webfrontend
        WEBFRONTEND_IMAGE=webfrontend:latest

        # Default container port for webfrontend
        WEBFRONTEND_PORT=8080
        ```

        Finally, the `docker-compose.yaml` file defines the services for both the API and front end:

        ```yaml title="./aspire-output/docker-compose.yaml"
        services:

## Verify your deployment

import csharpStarterPng from "@assets/get-started/csharp-starter.png";
import pythonStarterDarkPng from "@assets/get-started/python-starter-dark.png";
import pythonStarterLightPng from "@assets/get-started/python-starter-light.png";

To verify that your application is running as expected after deployment, follow the instructions for your chosen deployment target below.

<Tabs syncKey="deploy-target">
    <TabItem id="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

        When deploying to Docker Compose, you verify that your application is running by navigating to `http://localhost:{PORT}` in your web browser, where `{PORT}` is the port number you configured for your web frontend service in your Aspire application.

        ```bash title="Docker CLI - List running containers"
        docker ps
        ```        

        <Pivot id="csharp">

        After running the above command, look for an image with a name starting with `webfrontend:latest` and a `COMMAND` value similar to `dotnet /app/AspireApp.W...`. This indicates that your ASP.NET Core/Blazor application is running successfully.
        

        ```bash title="Docker CLI - List running containers" "0.0.0.0:55445->80/tcp"
        CONTAINER ID  IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED         STATUS        PORTS                  NAMES
        d4f1e8c3b6a1  webfrontend:latest  "dotnet /app/Aspire…"  10 seconds ago  Up 8 seconds  0.0.0.0:55445->80/tcp  aspire_app_webfrontend_1

        ```

        Find the port number in the `PORTS` column—it will look similar to `0.0.0.0:55445->80/tcp`. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:55445` (replace `55445` with your actual port number) to see your deployed application.

This indicates that your Python/React application is running successfully.

        Find the port number in the `PORTS` column—it will look similar to `0.0.0.0:53588->80/tcp`. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:53588` (replace `53588` with your actual port number) to see your deployed application.

## Clean up resources

After deploying your application, it's important to clean up resources to avoid incurring unnecessary costs or consuming local system resources.

<Tabs syncKey="deploy-target">
    <TabItem id="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
        To clean up resources after deploying with Docker Compose, you can stop and remove the running containers using the following command:

        ```bash title="Aspire CLI - Stop and remove containers"
        aspire do docker-compose-down-env
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem id="azure" label="Azure">
        To clean up resources after deploying to Azure, you can use the Azure CLI to delete the resource group that contains your application. This will remove all resources within the resource group.

        ```bash title="Azure CLI - Delete resource group"
        az group delete --name <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --yes --no-wait
        ```
    </TabItem>
