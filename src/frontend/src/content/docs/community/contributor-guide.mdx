## 📝 Write Markdown

Here are some common Markdown formatting examples to help you write documentation:

### Frontmatter

You can customize individual pages in `aspire.dev` by setting values in their frontmatter.
Frontmatter is set at the top of your files between `---` separators:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
---
title: My page title
---

Page content follows the second `---`.
```

Every page must include at least a `title`. See the [frontmatter reference](https://aspire.dev.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/) for all available fields and how to add custom fields.

### Headings

Use `#` symbols to create headings. More `#` symbols create smaller headings:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```

Headings are automatically created as bookmarks (shareable deep links) for easy navigation.

<Aside type="note">
  Avoid using Heading 1 (`#`) in your content, as it is reserved for the page title defined in frontmatter.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  To configure which headings appear in the **On this page** sidebar, use the `tableOfContents` frontmatter field. See the [tableOfContents reference](https://aspire.dev.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/) for more details.
</Aside>

### Text formatting

**Bold text** is created with double asterisks:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
**Bold text**
```

_Italic text_ is created with an `_` (or single asterisks `*`—while valid, for consistency we recommend using `_`):

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
_Italic text_
```

`Inline code` is created with backticks:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
`Inline code`
```

### Links

Links are created with square brackets and parentheses:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
[David Pine](https://davidpine.net)
```

Renders as:

[David Pine](https://davidpine.net)

Additionally, when linking to other pages within `aspire.dev`, use site relative paths:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
[Build your first Aspire app](/get-started/first-app/)
```

Renders as:

[Build your first Aspire app](/get-started/first-app/)

:::note
Site relative links should always include a trailing slash `/` at the end to ensure proper navigation.
<LearnMore>
This is confugred by default for `aspire.dev`, for more information see [Astro Docs: trailingSlash](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#trailingslash).
</LearnMore>
:::

### Lists

Unordered lists use `-` (or `*`—while valid, for consistency we recommend using `-`):

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

Renders as:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Ordered lists use numbers:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
1. First step
1. Second step
1. Third step
```

Renders as:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

<Aside type="note">
  Use `1.` for all items in an ordered list—Markdown will automatically number them correctly.
</Aside>

### Code blocks

Use triple backticks with a language identifier for syntax highlighting:

````md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("apiservice");
```
````

Renders as:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("apiservice");
```

To add a title to a code block, use this syntax:

````md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
```csharp title="Program.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("apiservice");
```
````

Renders as:

```csharp title="Program.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("apiservice");
```

### Blockquotes

Use `>` to create blockquotes:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
> This is a note or important callout.
```

Renders as:

> This is a note or important callout.

### Tables

Create tables using pipes `|` and hyphens `-`:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
| Feature | Description | Status |
|--|--|--|
| Dashboard | Web-based monitoring | ✅ Available |
| Telemetry | OpenTelemetry support | ✅ Available |
| Deployment | Kubernetes deployment | 🚧 Preview |
```

Renders as:

| Feature | Description | Status |
|--|--|--|
| Dashboard | Web-based monitoring | ✅ Available |
| Telemetry | OpenTelemetry support | ✅ Available |
| Deployment | Kubernetes deployment | 🚧 Preview |

<Aside type="tip">
  You can align columns using colons: `| :--- |` for left, `| :---: |` for center, and `| ---: |` for right alignment.
</Aside>

### Horizontal rules

Create a horizontal rule with three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
---
```

Renders as:

---

### Strikethrough

Use double tildes to create strikethrough text:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
~~This text is crossed out~~
```

Renders as:

~~This text is crossed out~~

### Task lists

Create interactive task lists in Markdown:

```md
- [x] Add Aspire to your project
- [x] Configure service defaults
- [ ] Deploy to Azure
- [ ] Set up monitoring
```

Renders as:

- [x] Add Aspire to your project
- [x] Configure service defaults
- [ ] Deploy to Azure
- [ ] Set up monitoring

### Nested lists

You can nest lists by indenting with two spaces:

```md
- Aspire components
  - Databases
    - PostgreSQL
    - Redis
  - Messaging
    - RabbitMQ
    - Azure Service Bus
```

Renders as:

- Aspire components
  - Databases
    - PostgreSQL
    - Redis
  - Messaging
    - RabbitMQ
    - Azure Service Bus

### Escaping characters

Use a backslash `\` to escape special Markdown characters:

```md
\*This text is not italic\*
\[This is not a link\]
```

Renders as:

\*This text is not italic\*
\[This is not a link\]

### Line breaks

End a line with two or more spaces to create a line break:

```md
First line with two spaces at the end  
Second line
```

Or use an empty line to create a paragraph break.

## ➕ Markdown extensions

The `aspire.dev` site supports several Markdown extensions to enhance your documentation:

### Mermaid diagrams

You can write mermaid diagrams as code blocks:

````md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[build-apiservice] --> C[push-apiservice]
    B[provision-container-registry] --> C
    C --> D[deploy-apiservice]
    E[provision-cosmosdb] --> D
    F[provision-identity] --> D
```
````

Renders as:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[build-apiservice] --> C[push-apiservice]
    B[provision-container-registry] --> C
    C --> D[deploy-apiservice]
    E[provision-cosmosdb] --> D
    F[provision-identity] --> D
```

### Asides

[Asides](https://starlight.astro.build/components/asides/), "admonitions", "callouts", or "alerts" are special highlighted blocks used to draw attention to important information, tips, warnings, or notes.

The `:::` syntax creates asides given a type of `note`, `tip`, `caution`, or `danger` in both Markdown and [MDX](#write-mdx):

````md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
:::note
Some content in an aside.
:::

:::caution
Some cautionary content.
:::

:::caution

Other content is also supported in asides.

```js
// A code snippet, for example.
```

:::

:::danger
Do not give your password to anyone.
:::
````

Renders as:

:::note
Some content in an aside.
:::

:::caution
Some cautionary content.
:::

:::caution

Other content is also supported in asides.

```js
// A code snippet, for example.
```

:::

:::danger
Do not give your password to anyone.
:::

Additionally, `aspire.dev` supports [GitHub Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) syntax with the [community plugin](https://starlight-github-alerts.netlify.app/getting-started/):

For example, you can write:

#### Note

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
```

Renders as:

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

## ☑️ Write MDX

<p id="write-mdx"></p>

MDX files use the `.mdx` extension and combine standard Markdown with the power of JSX. This means you can write content and seamlessly embed interactive components—all in one file.

<LearnMore>
[Learn more about MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/).
</LearnMore>

With the power of Astro components, you can enhance your documentation with interactive elements, custom layouts, and dynamic content. To use any of the built-in Starlight or custom components available in `aspire.dev`, simply import them at the top of your MDX file and use them like regular JSX components.

### LinkButton component

```mdx title="src/content/docs/example.mdx"
---
title: Example MDX Page
---

import { LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Here's an example of an MDX page with a custom button:

<LinkButton href="https://aspire.dev" variant="primary">
  Visit aspire.dev
</LinkButton>
```

Renders as:

Here's an example of an MDX page with a custom button:

<LinkButton href="https://aspire.dev" variant="primary">
  Visit aspire.dev
</LinkButton>

<LearnMore>
For all available components, see: [Starlight: Components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/).
</LearnMore>

### Aside component

The `Aside` component from Starlight can be used to create asides in your documentation:

````mdx title="src/content/docs/example.mdx"
---
title: Example MDX Page
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside>Some content in an aside.</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">Some cautionary content.</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">

  Other content is also supported in asides.

  ```js
  // A code snippet, for example.
  ```

</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">Do not give your password to anyone.</Aside>
````

Renders as:

<Aside>Some content in an aside.</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">Some cautionary content.</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">

Other content is also supported in asides.

```js
// A code snippet, for example.
```

</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">Do not give your password to anyone.</Aside>

### Using custom components

import tsConfig from "../../../../tsconfig.json?raw";

To use custom components available in `aspire.dev`, import them at the top of your MDX file. Custom component imports rely on configured aliases—have a look at the `tsconfig.json` file for more information:

<Code code={tsConfig} lang="json" title="JSON — tsconfig.json" mark={8} />

By using the `@components` alias, you can easily import any custom component from the `frontend/src/components/` directory. For example, to import the `LearnMore` component used in this guide:

```mdx title="src/content/docs/example.mdx"
---
title: Example MDX Page
---

import LearnMore from '@components/LearnMore.astro';

Here's an example of using the `LearnMore` component:

<LearnMore>
